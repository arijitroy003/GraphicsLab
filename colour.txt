You select a drawing color by passing either the color number itself or the equivalent symbolic name to setcolor. For example, in CGAC0 mode, the palette contains four colors: the background color, light green, light red, and yellow. In this mode, either setcolor(3) or setcolor(CGA_YELLOW) selects a drawing color of yellow.
